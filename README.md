NetNinja: Oracle Chatbot for Cybersecurity Attack Prediction

NetNinja is a cybersecurity-focused chatbot that protects against and predicts cyber attacks using time-series forecasting. As the first step in this project, we have considered five datasets for analysis.

**Datasets Considered:**

1. Cybersecurity Intrusion Data

2. Embedded System Network Security Dataset

3. Cybersecurity Dataset

4. GPS Spoofing Attack

5. DDoS Dataset

**Dataset Storage Structure**

All datasets are organized within the data folder, which contains the following subfolders:

1. raw/ → Contains the original versions of the five datasets

2. preprocessed/ → Contains the preprocessed versions of each dataset

**Model Training**

The preprocessed datasets are then used for training the prediction model.

**Dataset Access**

The datasets are available at the following Google Drive link:
